This error occurs when using the Expo `Constants.manifest` object to access app information within an Expo managed workflow app.  The `Constants.manifest` object sometimes returns `undefined` or a partially populated object, particularly when the app is started immediately after installation or if there's a caching issue. This can lead to unexpected behavior and crashes if your code relies on the manifest data.
